Основные положения касаются процедуры отбора проб, анализа и сертификации качества товара. Вот ключевые моменты:Метод отбора проб:ГАФТА предусматривает определенные методы отбора проб для разных видов продукции, чтобы обеспечить репрезентативность отобранных образцов. Обычно отбор проб осуществляется в соответствии с "GAFTA Sampling Rules", которые включают подробные указания о том, как, когда и где должны отбираться пробы.Объединение лотов:При отборе проб с разных лотов важно, чтобы каждый лот был протестирован отдельно, если иное не оговорено в контракте. Объединение проб с разных лотов в одну возможно только с согласия сторон и должно быть четко документировано.Частота отбора проб:Пробы обычно отбираются на каждом этапе транспортировки или хранения продукции, начиная от отгрузки и заканчивая доставкой. Частота отбора проб зависит от специфики контракта и характеристик товара.Размер пробы:Размеры проб устанавливаются в зависимости от объема партии. Например, на каждую тонну груза может предусматриваться отбор определенного количества килограммов для создания репрезентативной пробы.Документирование:Все пробы должны быть должным образом документированы. Пробы опечатываются и маркируются, а документы должны содержать информацию о лоте, дате и месте отбора, а также о методе отбора пробы.Анализ проб:Пробы анализируются в аккредитованных лабораториях, где проводится определение качества и других характеристик товара. В случае споров результаты анализа могут быть решающими для урегулирования претензий.Сертификация:По результатам анализа пробы выдается сертификат качества, который подтверждает соответствие продукции условиям контракта. Сертификат является юридически значимым документом.Разрешение споров:Если по итогам отбора проб или анализа возникают споры, они разрешаются в арбитраже GAFTA в соответствии с установленными правилами.'''

Importantly, the contract specifies that damages do not include loss of profit on any sub-contracts unless the arbitrator deems it appropriate under special circumstances."
},
{
    "prompt": "How does the contract handle force majeure events?",

The performance of the contract is suspended during the force majeure event. If the event continues for 21 days after the shipment period, the buyer has the option to cancel the unfulfilled portion of the contract.

    "prompt": "What is the procedure for handling disputes under the contract?",
    "completion": "Disputes under the GAFTA Contract No. 104 are to be resolved through arbitration according to GAFTA Arbitration Rules No. 125. The contract requires that any and all disputes, including claims regarding the interpretation or execution of the contract, be determined by arbitration. Legal proceedings cannot be initiated until the dispute has been resolved by the arbitrator(s) or a board of appeal. The contract emphasizes that obtaining an arbitration award is a condition precedent to any legal action. However, parties may seek legal proceedings to obtain security for a claim or counterclaim, but the merits of the dispute will still be settled through arbitration."

The contract is suspended for the duration of the force majeure event. If the event continues for 21 days beyond the shipment period, the buyer may cancel the unfulfilled portion of the contract. If the force majeure ends before cancellation, the seller is allowed the remaining time or a minimum of 14 days to complete the shipment."
},
{
    "prompt": "How is payment handled in this contract?",
    "completion": "Payment under GAFTA Contract No. 106 is typically made in cash on the date of delivery at the transhipment port, in exchange for the invoice. The seller may retain the original bill of lading or other documents of title as security until payment is received. If payment is unreasonably delayed, interest is charged at a rate appropriate to the currency involved. If the interest rate is not mutually agreed upon, the dispute is settled by arbitration.

If the goods do not meet the warranted quality, they are subject to allowances according to the GAFTA C.I.F. contract’s Quality Clause."
},
{
    "prompt": "What happens if there is a government order that delays the delivery of goods?",
    "completion": "If a government order prevents the movement of the goods before the expiry of the delivery period under GAFTA Contract No. 109, the seller must notify the buyer within 2 business days. Delivery is delayed until the order is lifted, for up to 30 consecutive days. If the delay exceeds 30 days, the buyer can cancel the delayed portion of the contract.

Документирование качества: Продавец должен документально подтвердить повышенное качество масла, получив официальные сертификаты от независимых инспекционных органов. Эти сертификаты подтверждают, что масло соответствует более высоким стандартам качества, чем указано в контракте.

Информирование покупателя: Продавец обязан уведомить покупателя о выявленном более высоком качестве масла. Это уведомление должно включать результаты анализа и сертификаты, подтверждающие качество.

Переоценка стоимости: В случае, если контракт предусматривает такие условия, продавец может обсудить с покупателем возможность изменения стоимости товара в связи с более высоким качеством масла. Однако, в большинстве случаев, если качество масла превышает заявленные параметры, стоимость товара остается неизменной, так как покупатель не несет дополнительных затрат.

Исполнение контракта: Если покупатель принимает более высокое качество масла, продавец продолжает выполнение контракта, предоставляя товар с улучшенными характеристиками без изменения цены, если это не оговорено иначе в контракте.

Арбитраж и разрешение споров: Если между сторонами возникает спор по поводу поставленного масла с более высоким качеством (например, если покупатель отказывается принимать товар или требует скидку), вопрос может быть передан на арбитраж в соответствии с правилами FOSFA.

Если контрактный период составляет 32 дня, и продавец не укладывается в этот срок, продление возможно, однако оно должно соответствовать правилам и положениям, предусмотренным контрактом, а также нормам GAFTA.

По базису CIF продавец может запросить продление срока, но покупатель не обязан принимать его условия автоматически. Согласно GAFTA 48, если покупатель согласится на продление, оно обычно сопровождается предоставлением скидки, как я упомянул ранее (например, 0.5% за 1-4 дня продления).

Продавец может инициировать запрос, но для этого необходимы согласие покупателя и учёт конкретных обстоятельств (например, наличие форс-мажора или непредвиденных задержек). Важно, чтобы условия продления были формализованы в письменном виде и согласованы всеми сторонами."
